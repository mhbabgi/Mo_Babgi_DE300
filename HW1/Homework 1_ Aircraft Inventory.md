**DATA_ENG 300 â€“ Spring 2025**  
**By:** Mo Babgi

##  Description
In this notebook, I explore and analyze the BTS aircraft inventory dataset from 2006 to 2023. The assignment focuses on handling missing data, transforming categorical columns, and performing feature engineering to analyze trends related to aircraft characteristics.

## Files Included
- `DE300_HW01_Mo_Babgi.ipynb`: Main notebook with all code, plots, and analysis.
- `DE300_HW01 Answers_Mo_Babgi.pdf`: Written answers and summary.
- `T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis (sourced from BTS).
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run the Notebook
The following Python libraries must be installed to run the notebook:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

The dataset `T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.csv` must be placed in the same directory as the notebook (or update the file path accordingly).

## Expected Outputs

The notebook will do the following when run:
- Report and visualize missing data.
- Apply imputations where possible.
- Clean and standardize columns where needed.
- Visualize distributions and apply Box-Cox transformations to reduce skewness.
- Create a `SIZE` column and analyze how aircraft size relates to operational and status proportions, and show plots for each category.
